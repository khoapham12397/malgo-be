### Installation

```
  git clone https://github.com/theksbd/bk-mathgorithm-server.git
```

Then type:

```
  npm install
```

to install all necessary packages for the project

### Run Server side

```
  npm run server
```

### [Optional] Run Prettier to beautify the code

```
  npm run prettier
```

or

```
  npm run prettier:fix

The first command will only check if there are any of ugly formatted codes then print them to the console, while the second one will not only check but also force the codes to be styled for us.
